Wabi-Sabi Structures adds a plethora of new structures that generate throughout your Minecraft world, all designed with the Japanese philosophy of "Wabi-Sabi" in mind - embracing imperfection while still being aesthetically interesting.

Our structures uniquely complement Minecraft's generation with little extra spices. Expect anything from patches of natural crops, to various cozy cabins, degraded stables, dangerous towers, ominous monoliths, underground eggs of mysterious creatures, and more. Our aim is to provide newfound excitement in exploring new terrain, in a way that allows each world, biome, and dimension to have enhanced variety.

In addition, many of our structures utilize mechanics present in vanilla Minecraft in order to showcase these features to players or alleviate issues in the base game - a tower in the Forest that teaches lighting and extinguishing Campfires, factory ruins in the Nether with a Basalt generator, an orchard in the End featuring different Note Block instruments, to name just a few. The loot found in certain structures might also include items that cannot be obtained otherwise in survival Minecraft, but in a way that is not game-breaking.

# Creating Issues
You can use the Issue Tracker on this GitHub to report bugs or any other issues with the mod or datapack.

When creating an issue, we reccommend you:
  - State the version of the mod and Forge or Fabric version you are using
  - Specify if it is Singleplayer or Multiplayer
  - Provide a detailed description of the problem (describe in steps if necessary!)
  - Provide crash logs if there are any
  - Provide a list of mods if there are multiple
  - Provide a picture if it applies to your problem
  
Including these important details makes it easier for us to pinpoint the cause of your issue, and makes it less likely for your post to be ignored or closed.

We have many more plans for new structures and themed updates in the future, which will include usage of jigsaws to create even larger and more impressive structures.
